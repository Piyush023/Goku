This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Live Streaming Solution Documentation
Overview
This documentation outlines the setup and components for a live streaming solution that captures video and audio from a client's browser, processes it using ffmpeg, and streams it to platforms like YouTube and Facebook using RTMP. The solution consists of a client-side application (built with React or Next.js) and a server-side application (built with Node.js and Express).

Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js / Next.js: For building the user interface and managing the client-side logic.
Browser APIs: To access the camera and microphone.
Backend
Node.js: For server-side scripting and handling incoming media streams.
Express.js: For creating the server and managing routes and middleware.
Socket.IO: For real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
Child Process (Node.js): To spawn ffmpeg processes for media stream processing.
Media Processing
FFmpeg: A powerful CLI tool for video and audio processing, used to encode, decode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter, and play multimedia files.
Streaming Protocol
RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol): A protocol for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet.
Containerization
Docker: For containerizing the FFmpeg application to ensure consistent environments across different systems.
Components and Workflow
Client-Side (React/Next.js)
Browser Access:

Access the camera and microphone using the browser's API. Display a "Start Streaming" button to initiate the streaming process.

Streaming Button:

When clicked, the button will start capturing the media stream from the user's camera and microphone. The captured media stream will be sent to the Node.js server for processing.

Server-Side (Node.js with Express)
Media Stream Reception:

The server receives the media stream from the client. It uses Socket.IO for real-time communication to handle the incoming stream data.

Processing with FFmpeg:

A child process is spawned to run ffmpeg with specific options to process the video and audio streams. FFmpeg options include setting the codec, bitrate, frame rate, and other necessary parameters for streaming.

RTMP Streaming:

The processed media stream is forwarded to an RTMP endpoint. RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is used for streaming the processed media to platforms like YouTube and Facebook.

Technical Details
RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)
RTMP is a TCP-based protocol designed for low-latency connections, making it ideal for live streaming. It breaks large data files into small packets, which are sent sequentially and reassembled by the receiver.

WebSockets/Socket.IO
WebSockets, facilitated by Socket.IO, enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. This is essential for streaming applications where latency and real-time data transmission are critical.

Docker and FFmpeg
Docker is used to containerize ffmpeg, ensuring consistent environments across different systems. FFmpeg is a powerful CLI tool for video and audio processing, used here to handle streaming, upscaling, and downscaling operations.

Implementation
Client-Side Code (React/Next.js)
Capture Media Stream:

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
  .then(stream => {
    // Handle the stream
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error accessing media devices.', error);
  });
Start Streaming Button:

<button onClick={startStreaming}>Start Streaming</button>

const startStreaming = () => {
  // Capture the stream and send it to the server
};
Server-Side Code (Node.js with Express)
Setup Express and Socket.IO:

import express from 'express';
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { Server as SocketIO } from 'socket.io';
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

const app = express();
const server = createServer(app);
const io = new SocketIO(server);
FFmpeg Process and RTMP:

const options = [
  '-i', '-',
  '-c:v', 'libx264',
  '-preset', 'ultrafast',
  '-tune', 'zerolatency',
  '-r', '25',
  '-g', '50',
  '-keyint_min', '25',
  '-crf', '25',
  '-pix_fmt', 'yuv420p',
  '-sc_threshold', '0',
  '-profile:v', 'main',
  '-level', '3.1',
  '-c:a', 'aac',
  '-b:a', '128k',
  '-ar', '32000',
  '-f', 'flv',
  'rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/your-stream-key'
];

const ffmpegProcess = spawn('ffmpeg', options);

io.on('connection', socket => {
  socket.on('binaryStream', data => {
    ffmpegProcess.stdin.write(data);
  });
});
Start Server:

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
